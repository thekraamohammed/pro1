      <h2>A little about Herbert George Wells.</h2>

      <p>His non-fiction output included works of social commentary, politics, history, popular science, satire, biography and autobiography. Wells is now best remembered for his science fiction novels and has been called the "father of science fiction.</p>

          In addition to his fame as a writer, he was prominent in his lifetime as a forward-looking, even prophetic social critic who devoted his literary talents to the development of a progressive vision on a global scale.
        </li>
        <li>
        Wells rendered his works convincing by instilling commonplace detail alongside a single extraordinary assumption per work – dubbed “Wells's law” – leading Joseph Conrad to hail him in 1898 as "O Realist of the Fantastic!

         Pope Paul VI named him Apostolic Administrator of the Territorial Prelate of São Félix. In <strong>1971</strong>, the Pope named him prelate of that jurisdiction and titular bishop of Altava.

      <p>Early life.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <em>Herbert George Wells was born at Atlas House, 162 High Street in Bromley, Kent,[13] on 21 September 1866.[2] Called "Bertie" by his family, he was the fourth and last child of Joseph Wells, a former domestic gardener, and at the time a shopkeeper and professional cricketer and Sarah Neal, a former domestic servant. An inheritance had allowed the family to acquire a shop in which they sold china and sporting goods, although it failed to prosper: the stock was old and worn out, and the location was poor. </em>
        </li>
        <li>
         A defining incident of young Wells's life was an accident in 1874 that left him bedridden with a broken leg.[2] To pass the time he began to read books from the local library, brought to him by his father. He soon became devoted to the other worlds and lives to which books gave him access; they also stimulated his desire to write. <em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>"Teacher."</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          In October 1879, Wells's mother arranged through a distant relative, Arthur Williams, for him to join the National School at Wookey in Somerset as a pupil–teacher, a senior pupil who acted as a teacher of younger children.
        </li>
        <li>
        n December that year, however, Williams was dismissed for irregularities in his qualifications and Wells was returned to Uppark. 
        </li>
        <li>
         After a short apprenticeship at a chemist in nearby Midhurst and an even shorter stay as a boarder at Midhurst Grammar School, he signed his apprenticeship papers at Hyde's. In 1883, Wells persuaded his parents to release him from the apprenticeship, taking an opportunity offered by Midhurst Grammar School again to become a pupil–teacher; his proficiency in Latin and science during his earlier short stay had been remembered.
        </li>
        <li>
    The following year, Wells won a scholarship to the Normal School of Science (later the Royal College of Science in South Kensington, now part of Imperial College London) in London, studying biology under Thomas Henry Huxley.
        </li>
        <li>
         As an alumnus, he later helped to set up the Royal College of Science Association, of which he became the first president in 1909. Wells studied in his new school until 1887, with a weekly allowance of 21 shillings (a guinea) thanks to his scholarship.
        </li>
        <li>
          This ought to have been a comfortable sum of money (at the time many working class families had "round about a pound a week" as their entire household income),[22] yet in his Experiment in Autobiography Wells speaks of constantly being hungry, and indeed photographs of him at the time show a youth who is very thin and malnourished
